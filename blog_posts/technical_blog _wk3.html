<h2> Hashes and Arrays</h2>
<h3> When to use Which?</h3>
<p> Hashes vs Arrays can be an interesting discussion. Why would you use either or both? Well let's start out with working definitions. Hashes are category based with keys and corresponding values for a larger descriptor. Think animals, what animals? Well lions and tiger, and bears. These being the 'key animals'(no pun intended) they have value like mountain lions, Bengal tiger, or Polar Bears. While they have corresponding keys they are not ranked, (bears are no better than tigers or lions). This is where Arrays come in. What if you are at the Olympics and need to have a tally of the medals for each country. You want information placed in a specific order so you can identify the type of medal and the country of the olympian. Arrays can help create ordered pairs where the value is corresponded with a number value. That number value can be called on to give a specific value. So a gold is 1, silver is 2, bronze is 3. But one array it is limited to those values and another array can be placed to find the countries (with a numberic code). So for more individualized and complex structures Hashes can help you build up categoies but for a simple categorization Arrays can help to organize data. Often times Arrays will be compounded to become part of Hashes to maintain both complexity of categories and numeric simplificiation within categories. So really it has a lot to do with the data you are using and how the developer wants to utilizer and call that data later.  </p>
