 <h2> My learning style:<h2>
 
 <p> My learning style is concrete random and abstract random with a slight preference to aural learning.  It is clear to me that I need to be around people and talking to people while experimenting to get the most out of my learning experience. I need to pair more often then I am and take more risks!  That is something I have been holding back because I want to be cautious about my learning but I am realizing that is not how I learn so it makes it clear I need to be around my cohort more often, hopefully I can find people who enjoy that learning style! As far as a growth mindset vs. a fixed mindset, I am realizing that a growth mindset is about being willing to be a complete fool while learning.  To accept and enjoy being green. I think just being open to asking questions again and feel like I am not suppose to know it all is a wonderful feeling and allows so much space for growth/curiosity.  This for me has been more a process of learning how to maintain long strides of curiosity in my learning process without actually knowing the "right" answer.  That in itself is awe inspiring, how free connections find their way aw you are working.  It is reminding me of the real process of learning. </p>
