 <h2> My learning style:<h2>
 
 <p> My learning style is concrete random and abstract random with a slight preference to aural learning.  It is clear to me that I need to be around people and talking to people while experimenting to get the most out of my learning experience. I need to pair more often then I am and take more risks!  That is something I have been holding back because I want to be cautious about my learning but I am realizing that is not how I learn so it makes it clear I need to be around my cohort more often, hopefully I can find people who enjoy that learning style!  </p>
