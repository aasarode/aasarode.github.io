	<h3> I think the true beauty of this program is its ability to teach real learning.  I find that the culture of Dev's Bootcamp is the primary reason I was interested in joining the program. I was very stunted with creativity in my current field and being a life long learner, just a job wasn't enough.  And when I started to talking to people and exploring San Francisco, I stumbled upon Dev's Bootcamp. A former student said  " it taught me how to learn, and that is invaluable." Much of traditional schooling for me was about rote memorization. I realized very early on this method never really demonstrated competency at the highest levels.  I really disliked it, I often found myself learning and associating material on my own, making my own life connections.  As I did I was able to retain and use this material everyday, and more importantly integrate supposedly unrelated ideas together. I think the creativity to explore new connections is the cornerstone of learning in my eyes.  At yet creativity if laced with failures and the fine line of navigating maintaing self confidence and maintaining vulnerability/humbleness is a line I am realzing that I am going to have to further learn on my journey.  My expectations of the program were a lot more intense in my perception then the way Shereef had explained it.  I realize that there is a large collaborative process and the team process is much more important then just individual coding practices.  I am very nervous knowing I will have to work in this environment, but I keep reminding myself it is the effort not the talent.  So if I don't know it now, I just need to keep working on it until I am able to learn it.  The one thing I am really learning about myself is my tendency to go down rabbit holes too far...I like the space that is created to explore but move forward.  It is another type of balance I will have to create for myself. So overall, I am excited!</h3>
