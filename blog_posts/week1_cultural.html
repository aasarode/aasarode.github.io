	<h2>Cultural Assignment</h2>
	<p> I think the true beauty of this program is its ability to teach real  (I know that sounds like an oxymoron).  I find that the culture of Dev's Bootcamp is the primary reason I was interested in joining the program.  As it was stated to me, it "taught me how to learn, and this is invaluable." Much of traditional schooling for me was about rote memorization and the I realized very early on this method never really demonstrated competency.  I really disliked it, I often found myself learning and associating material on my own, making my own life connections.  As I did I was able to retain and use this material everyday, and more importantly integrate supposedly unrelated ideas together. I think the creativity to explore new connections is the cornerstone of learning in my eyes.  The fine line of navigating having enough self confidence and maintaining vulnerability and humbleness is a line I am realzing that I am going to have to further learn on my journey.  My expectations of the program were a lot more intense in my perception then the way Shereef had explained it.  I realize that there is a large collaborative process and the team process is much more important then just individual coding practices.  I am very nervious knowing I will have to work in this environment, but I keep reminding myself it is the effort not the talent.  So if I don't know it now, I just need to keep working on it until I am able to learn it.  The one thing I really learning about myself is my tendency to go down rabbit holes too far...I like the space that is created to explore but move forward.  It is another type of balance I will have to create for myself.
