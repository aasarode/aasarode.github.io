	<h2> Hashes </h2>
		<p>A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.
		A Hash can be easily created by using its implicit form: grades = { "Jane Doe" => 10, "Jim Doe" => 6 }
			example : Hash.each do |key, array|
            		  puts "#{key}-----"
  					  puts array 
  					  end
</p>
	<h2> Arrays </h2>
		<p> Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.
		example : Array.new(4) { Hash.new } #=> [{}, {}, {}, {}]
</p>
	<h2> Strings </h2>
		<p> A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters. String objects may be created using String::new or as literals.Because of aliasing issues, users of strings should be aware of the methods that modify the contents of a String object. Typically, methods with names ending in “!” modify their receiver, while those without a “!” return a new String. However, there are exceptions, such as String#[]=.
		example : new(str="") → new_str 
</p>
	<h2> Integers </h2>
		<p>Integer is the basis for the two concrete classes that hold whole numbers, Bignum and Fixnum.
		example :  1, 10, 3000, .99,
