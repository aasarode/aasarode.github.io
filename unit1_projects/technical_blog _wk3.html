<h2> Javascript, Why is it Popular? </h2>
<p> From seeing the use of javascript in many websites, it is clear that there is more movement and interaction with the 
use of javascript in webpage design. A great website <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/things-you-didnt-know-javascript-could-do-6122835">10 things you didn't know Javascript could do</a> gives us a taste.  Flash players, mobile app designs, hangouts in webpages, screenshots.  This creates a much more interactive user interface, this really helps people connect to the page using the  newest technological interfaces.  My favorite is that Javascript can be used to work with kinect, so you can use you're hands to manage a screen!  This takes the webpage out of just being like a "paper page" and that is a wonderful tool!  </p>
