            What is pair programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Working in dyads with one person being the navigator of the code and the other person the driver.  The pair works on creating the code together. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Why is pair programming important to DBC?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Helps the pair learn and find errors by having a cooperative environment. Having two people  together working on the code helps to solidify and create "aha" moments.

            Driver vs. Navigator
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Driver
        </h3>
        <p>
            The person in the dyad that physically drives the coding by typing and determining proper syntex.
        </p>
        <h3>
           Navigator
        </h3>
        <p>
            The person who directs the driver with the appropriate generalized steps. Depending on level of competency the person will talk in pseudo code and or help with the code syntax.
