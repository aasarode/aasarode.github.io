<h2> Absolute positioning </h2>
<p> s when elements are positioned against a parent element and are relative that parent image. A simple way to understand this by thinking of our solor system: all the planets are positions are relative to the position of the sun that is at the center of our solar system. Much like we know that the earth is the 3rd planet and always is, in any diagram it would maintain that position to the sun.  Much like this the elements of a webpage (pictures, words, ect..) are placed in depending on the position of the main item on the page.  In otherwords the "sun" item is the center and all the other items follow suit accordingly, if we moved the sun all the planets would follow suit in certain the prescribed order (Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc).</p>


<h2>Relative positioning</h2>
<p> Relative position is the position of the element in regard to the page.An analogy of this would be similar to a young child that never leaves its mother's side.  The mother can move anywhere in the home but the child is always on right side of the mother.  He/she will never leave that position, but the child moves only if the mother moves.  So if mom (primary element) goes to kitchen from the living room (scroll down to bottom of page) the child is always there on her left side (the element is always on prescribed position.) </p></p>

<h2>Fixed positioning</h2>
<p> This is elements are fixed relative to the browser window.  So no matter where you go on the page the element will stay in the same space on the page. This is like many pop up adds that you find, no matter where you scroll the image is dead center unless you close the window. This window will be on top of all othe items on your page. So much like finding a scratch on your glasses, no matter where you look the scratch will be in the same position in your line of sight no matter where you turn your head.   </p>
